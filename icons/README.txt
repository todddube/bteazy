ICON FILES NEEDED
=================

This folder needs three icon files for the extension to work:

1. icon16.png  (16x16 pixels)
2. icon48.png  (48x48 pixels)
3. icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

HOW TO CREATE ICONS:
--------------------

Option 1: Use the Icon Generator (Recommended)
1. Open generate-icons.html in your web browser (located in the parent folder)
2. Click "Download All Icons"
3. Move the downloaded PNG files into this folder

Option 2: Create Custom Icons
1. Use any image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, Paint.NET, etc.)
2. Create three PNG images with the dimensions listed above
3. Design your icon (should represent downloading or torrents)
4. Save them in this folder with the exact filenames above

Option 3: Use Online Tools
1. Visit https://realfavicongenerator.net/ or similar icon generator
2. Upload a single image
3. Generate icons in multiple sizes
4. Download and rename to match the required filenames

IMPORTANT:
- File names must be exactly: icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png
- All files must be PNG format
- Icons should have transparent or colored backgrounds
- The extension will not work without these icon files
